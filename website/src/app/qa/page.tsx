                <p>
                    I started learning to code in 2016, after my bachelor&apos;s degree in Design. I was working as a
                    graphic designer, but I wanted to learn how to code to be able to create my own websites and apps. I
                    was taught HTML and CSS in college, but I didn&apos;t know anything about JavaScript. I started
                    learning JavaScript on my own, and I was able to get a job as a FrontEnd Developer after 6 months of
                    self-learning. I&apos;ve been working as a FrontEnd Developer since 2017.
