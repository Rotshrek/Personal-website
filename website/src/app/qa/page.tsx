                <p className="mb-4 mt-6 font-bold">How did I learn to code?</p>
                <p>
                    I started learning to code in 2016, after my bachelor's degree in Design. I was working as a graphic
                    designer, but I wanted to learn how to code to be able to create my own websites and apps. I was
                    taught HTML and CSS in college, but I didn't know anything about JavaScript. I started learning
                    JavaScript on my own, and I was able to get a job as a FrontEnd Developer after 6 months of
                    self-learning. I've been working as a FrontEnd Developer since 2017.
