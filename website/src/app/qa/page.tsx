                <p className="mb-4 mt-6 font-bold">How did I learn to code?</p>
                <p>
                    I started learning how to code in 2016, after my bachelor&apos;s degree in Design. I was working as a
                    graphic designer, but I wanted to learn some code to be able to create my own websites and apps. I
                    was taught HTML and CSS in college, but I didn&apos;t know anything about Javascript. I started
                    learning JavaScript on my own, and I was able to get a job as a FrontEnd Developer after 6 months of
                    self-learning. I&apos;ve been working as a FrontEnd Developer since 2017.

                <p className="mb-4 mt-6 font-bold">How did I end up in Norway?</p>
                <p>
                    My and my wife moved from Chile to Norway in August 2022. She studied a master&apos;s
                    degree in Interaction Design at NTNU in Gj√∏vik where we lived for a year and a half. We moved to
                    Stavanger in January 2024 because I found work as a developer here, and not long after that, she
                    found a job as a UX Designer. We&apos;re happy living in Stavanger, and we&apos;re planning to stay
                    here for the foreseeable future.

                <p>
                    I have a family immigration permit, which allows me to work full-time in Norway without any
                    restrictions{" "}

                    My current residence permit is valid until 2027. I also have a norwegian ID number and bank
                    account. And I have been working a full time job in Norway since February 2024.

                    We moved to Stavanger because of work and my wife has also found a job here. We&apos;re happy living
